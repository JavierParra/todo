# ToDo
This is a repository for ToDo apps in the languages I'm currently learning.

They will be divided in server and client apps.

The requirements for the client apps are:
 - Ability to save To Do's locally.
 - Ability to synchronize with the server app.
 - Ability to receive changes from the server app using WebSockets or similar.
 
 The requirements for the server apps are:
 - Push changes to clients app using WebSockets or similar.
 - Full implementation of the APIâ€¦ that I'm yet to document.
 - Saving To Do's to a permanent storage.
